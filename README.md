# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, all implemented in C++ as part of my ongoing journey to strengthen my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It serves as a **learning-focused resource**, where I aim to consistently practice problem-solving, refine my coding skills, and explore multiple approaches to the same problem. Each solution is written with attention to clarity, efficiency, and readability, and includes detailed comments explaining the approach, algorithm, and complexity analysis. 

The repository also functions as a personal **progress tracker**, allowing me to revisit concepts, identify patterns, and improve my problem-solving strategies over time. While currently organized by difficulty to maintain a structured learning path, it will evolve as I tackle more problems, eventually incorporating topic-based organization and optimized solutions. This project reflects both my commitment to mastering fundamental DSA concepts and my focus on developing clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

## Repository Structure
- `easy/`   – Easy level problems
- `medium/` – Medium level problems
- `hard/`   – Hard level problems

## Language
- C++

## Notes
- This repository represents a learning journey; solutions may evolve with better approaches and optimizations over time.
- Each problem is implemented in a separate file, named using the LeetCode problem number and title. 
- It can serve as a reference for **revision** and tracking my **DSA progress over time**.
